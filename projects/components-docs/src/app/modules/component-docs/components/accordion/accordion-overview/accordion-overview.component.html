<p>
  The <code>cui-accordion</code> component is an accessible accordion similar to
  the
  <a
    class="cui-link"
    href="https://material.angular.io/components/expansion/overview"
    target="_blank"
  >
    Angular Material expansion panel</a
  >. It differs in that the button to expand and collapse the accordion body is
  limited to just a single left justified button inside of the header panel
  instead of the entire header panel itself being the button. This allows us to
  place other actionable items (buttons, links, etc.) inside of the accordion
  header panel without creating any accessibility issues, because screen readers
  cannot correctly interpret nested buttons.

  <br />
  In other words, if we put a button inside of the header of the
  <a
    class="cui-link"
    href="https://material.angular.io/components/expansion/overview"
    target="_blank"
  >
    Angular Material expansion panel</a
  >, then we create a situation where there is a button inside of another
  button, which confuses assistive technology. The CoreUI accordion provides an
  accessible alternative to this pattern.
