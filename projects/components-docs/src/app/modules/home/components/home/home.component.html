    The goal of a design system is to create inclusive, usable, and predictable
    experiences that allow our users to stay focused on the task at hand rather
    than on the inconsistencies of the interfaces they're using. We strive to
    follow web accessibility guidelines set by
    <a class="cui-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank"
      >WCAG 2.1</a
    >
    to create applications accessible to all, because accessible experiences for
    some are better experiences for everyone.

    This design system is an extension of the Angular Material Design system and
    is distributed internally within Progressive Claims as the
    <code>@pgr-cla/core-ui-components</code> npm package. This documentation is
    supplementary to the
    <a class="cui-link" href="https://material.angular.io/" target="_blank"
      >Angular Material</a
    >
    documentation and both should be referenced while developing applications
    using this package.
